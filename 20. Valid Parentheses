Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        
        check = {'(':')','{':'}','[':']'}
        stack = []
        
        for item in s:
            if item in ['(','{','[']:
                stack.append(check[item])
                
            elif not stack or item != stack.pop():
                return False
            
        return stack == []
 1. By using stack to store the paired parentheses and check if the stack is empty or if the left parentheses are matched.
